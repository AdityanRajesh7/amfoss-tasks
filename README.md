## SELF INTRO
Hello all. I am Adityan Rajesh, a first year from the Data Science - AI batch. I originally hail from Malappuram, Kerala. I have had a passion towards computers since an early age. However, I never got a chance to enter the coding world until recently. I wish to utilise my passion to bridge a bright future ahed.

## INTROSPECTION

### WHY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE ME?
I believe I can prove by the end of the task deadline why I must chosen, as I aim to give my all to showcase my passion and skill for the platform that amfoss stands for. I believe I can continue learning each day to become a worthy member of the club.

### MY GOALS FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS
I wish to learn more about coding in general. I have a good hold on the basics of Python. But the rest are still out there for me to learn. I also intend to learn more about the functions of the club to put forth my contribution.

### HOW i WOULD CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB
I will do my best to learn from my mentors, and then later omn assist them for the club activities. I believe that I have what it takes to be the guy who continues the legacy of the club in the future.
