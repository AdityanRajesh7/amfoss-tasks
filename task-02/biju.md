## Intro About Me


I am Adityan Rajesh, hailing from Perinthalanna in Malappuram, Kerala. I am a registered Wikipedia editor and state-level prize holder in Power-point presentation. After completing my schooling in Perinthalmanna, I am at present enrolled in a  B-Tech in Data Science & AI from Amrita University, Amritapuri. My journey as a Wikipedia editor began on October 2020. I pride myself on the being the editor who created the Wikipedia page for Karikku, a malayalam youtube channel. This portfolio is incomplete at the moment, as many of my projects in college are yet to be uploaded here. But they will all be uploaded in due time.
